# Face Verification using Siamese Network Architecture with Binary Loss

This project implements face verification using Siamese Network architecture with binary loss. The Siamese network is a neural network architecture that learns to differentiate between two input images. It is commonly used in tasks where pairs of inputs need to be compared, such as face verification and signature verification.

## Overview

The goal of face verification is to determine whether two given images contain the same person's face or not. Siamese networks are particularly well-suited for this task because they can learn to extract and compare features from pairs of images.

This project utilizes the binary loss function, which is commonly used in Siamese networks for face verification tasks. The binary loss function encourages the network to output similar embeddings for images of the same person and dissimilar embeddings for images of different people.

## Dataset

The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset is used for training and evaluation. LFW is a popular benchmark dataset for face recognition tasks, containing over 13,000 labeled images of faces collected from the web. Each image is labeled with the identity of the person depicted.

## Architecture

The Siamese network architecture consists of two identical subnetworks (twins) that share the same parameters. Each subnetwork takes an input image and produces a feature embedding. These embeddings are then compared using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) to determine the similarity between the input images.

## Training

The Siamese network is trained using pairs of images from the LFW dataset. During training, the network learns to minimize the binary loss function, which measures the dissimilarity between the embeddings of two input images.

## Evaluation

The trained Siamese network is evaluated on a separate validation set or test set from the LFW dataset. The performance of the network is typically measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Usage

To use the trained Siamese network for face verification:

1. Prepare the input images.
2. Load the trained model.
3. Extract embeddings for pairs of images using the model.
4. Compare the embeddings to determine the similarity between the images.
